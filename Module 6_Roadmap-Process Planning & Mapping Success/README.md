For this module, my team and I developed a detailed project roadmap for the XN Project, outlining the steps and processes required to achieve our goals for Yeoman Technology Group (YTG). Our roadmap included a clear analytic approach, specifying the exploratory data analysis, business intelligence, and machine learning techniques we planned to use to optimize brand performance and sales on Amazon. We also defined key milestones, job assignments for each team member, and measures of success, ensuring accountability and progress tracking throughout the project. By planning ahead, we could anticipate potential challenges and implement strategies to mitigate risks related to data quality, system integration, and data security.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in process planning and collaborative project management. I focused on exploratory data analysis, cleaning and transforming data, and preparing visualizations to uncover trends in Amazon sales and advertising performance. Developing this roadmap allowed me to think strategically about resource allocation, risk management, and presentation delivery, while also ensuring our final recommendations would be actionable and data-driven. Overall, this module reinforced the importance of structured planning and coordination in achieving meaningful insights and results in a complex, real-world data project.
