In this module, my team and I developed a working draft of our XN Project, focusing on enhancing digital sales and marketing for Yeoman Technology Group (YTG) using Amazon data. We integrated preliminary feedback and structured our analysis to address the business problem of helping pre-Internet brands improve their online presence without disrupting existing retail channels. My contributions included conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), developing visualizations, and synthesizing insights from the dataset to identify high-impact areas such as search query performance, brand share, and advertising effectiveness. The draft incorporates key models like the Brand Influence and Ad Spend Optimization models, providing actionable recommendations to improve conversion rates and brand positioning on Amazon.

Through this process, I learned the importance of iterating on project materials based on stakeholder and instructor feedback, balancing technical analysis with clear communication, and aligning our outputs with client expectations. The draft project allowed us to highlight market dynamics, identify opportunities for smaller brands, and propose strategies to optimize high-click, low-purchase queries. By developing dashboards, charts, and preliminary association mining insights, we laid the groundwork for a data-driven, actionable final presentation that will inform YTG’s digital marketing strategy and provide measurable business value.
