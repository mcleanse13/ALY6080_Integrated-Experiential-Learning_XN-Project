For this module, I focused on evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the datasets provided by Yeoman Technology Group (YTG) and exploring how data can be used to tell a compelling story about business performance. My work emphasized the importance of data storytelling in guiding decisions and engaging stakeholders. I examined scenarios such as shifts in customer purchasing behavior from traditional retail to Amazon, using the data to highlight challenges and opportunities for companies transitioning to digital platforms. By identifying trends, outliers, and skewness in the datasets, I assessed how these factors could positively or negatively influence insights and recommendations.

Through this project, I gained a deeper appreciation for the role of data quality, visualization, and interpretation in business decision-making. I explored techniques like histograms to check for skewness and considered how errors or biases in data could affect conclusions. The project reinforced the need to prioritize accurate and complete data to ensure meaningful analyses that drive actionable strategies. Overall, this assignment helped me understand how careful evaluation and storytelling with data can optimize business performance, enhance customer engagement, and support companies in successfully navigating the shift to digital sales channels.
