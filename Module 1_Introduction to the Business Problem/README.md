For our XN project, my team and I worked with Yeoman Technology Group (YTG) to develop a data-driven strategy for enhancing their digital sales and marketing on Amazon. My role involved analyzing Amazon data to uncover insights on market share clicks, search query performance, and brand influence. I contributed to exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and visualization efforts, helping to identify trends, optimize advertising spend, and improve conversion rates. By examining key metrics such as clicks versus purchases, brand frequency, and association mining, we were able to recommend strategies to enhance visibility, increase engagement, and boost overall sales performance for YTG’s clients.

Through this project, I gained firsthand experience in applying business intelligence, machine learning, and data visualization techniques to real-world e-commerce challenges. I also participated in regular stakeholder engagement sessions, ensuring that our analysis aligned with the company’s goals and expectations. Overall, this project reinforced the importance of data-driven decision-making in guiding multi-channel brands through the complexities of digital transformation, while balancing the needs of existing wholesale and retail channels.
