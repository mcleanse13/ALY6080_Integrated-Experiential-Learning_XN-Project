In this final module, my team and I developed the rough final draft of our XN Project, delivering a strategic plan to enhance digital sales and marketing for Yeoman Technology Group (YTG) using Amazon data. I contributed to synthesizing insights from exploratory data analysis (EDA), building predictive models, and developing visualizations that highlight market share, search query performance, and advertising effectiveness. Our analysis identified high-impact areas for both top-performing and smaller brands, and we generated actionable recommendations to optimize advertising spend, improve conversion rates, and strengthen brand positioning. The draft also includes guidance on using our dashboards and models, making it accessible for stakeholders to implement strategies based on the insights provided.

Throughout this process, I focused on integrating feedback from our instructor and peers, ensuring alignment with YTG’s business objectives, and maintaining clear, concise communication of our findings. I also emphasized ethical handling of data, stakeholder engagement, and structured project management to ensure quality deliverables. The draft sets the foundation for the final presentation, demonstrating how data-driven strategies and predictive analytics can help YTG transition to digital platforms, enhance market competitiveness, and make informed business decisions in a complex, competitive landscape.
