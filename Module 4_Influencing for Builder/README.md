For this module, my team and I developed a comprehensive interview guide to engage stakeholders at Yeoman Technology Group (YTG) and clarify key aspects of our project. The primary goal of the guide was to ensure we fully understood the business objectives, data availability, and challenges associated with optimizing brand performance on Amazon. By preparing thoughtful questions in advance, we aimed to address any uncertainties, explore the metrics and KPIs that YTG values, and identify data gaps that could affect our analysis. This process also allowed us to align expectations with stakeholders and set the stage for more effective collaboration as the project progressed.

Through this exercise, I gained firsthand experience in designing structured interviews that facilitate clear communication and informed decision-making. I focused on framing questions around business outcomes, data sources, and potential limitations while considering the broader context of how non-digital-native clients adapt to online marketplaces. By anticipating challenges and opportunities in the data, the guide helped ensure that our team could extract actionable insights from YTG’s datasets and make recommendations that were both practical and strategic. Overall, this project reinforced the importance of stakeholder engagement and proactive questioning in driving successful data-driven solutions.
