In this module, my team and I developed a comprehensive project scope for the XN Project, defining the boundaries and objectives needed to focus our analysis and deliver actionable insights from the Amazon dataset provided by Yeoman Technology Group (YTG). Our scope clarified what was in and out of the project’s focus, prioritizing either the five largest or five smallest brands to uncover correlations between spending and profit, while ensuring that all analysis remained achievable within the class timeline. By establishing clear expectations, constraints, and measures of success, we were able to align our work with both academic and professional standards while preparing for subsequent presentations and stakeholder interactions.

Through this process, I contributed to drafting the exploratory data analysis plan, identifying gaps in the strategy, and coordinating stakeholder engagement. I learned the importance of clearly defining project boundaries, balancing quality with time and resources, and maintaining consistent communication with team members and stakeholders. This structured approach not only helped us focus on meaningful insights but also ensured that our final deliverables would be actionable, ethical, and aligned with the sponsor’s goals, reinforcing the value of effective project scoping in data-driven decision-making.
