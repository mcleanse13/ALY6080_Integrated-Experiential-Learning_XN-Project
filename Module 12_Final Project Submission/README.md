In this final module, my team and I delivered our Sponsor Project for Yeoman Technology Group (YTG), presenting a comprehensive strategic plan to enhance digital sales and marketing using Amazon data. I contributed to the development of predictive models and interactive dashboards, synthesizing insights from exploratory data analysis, brand share metrics, search query performance, and conversion data. Together, we identified high-value areas for advertising, optimized ad spend, and provided actionable recommendations to improve conversion rates and strengthen brand positioning. The deliverable includes a “how-to” guide for using the dashboards and models, ensuring that YTG stakeholders can leverage our analysis effectively.

Throughout this process, I actively reflected on my contributions and collaborated closely with my team to incorporate feedback from both peers and our instructor. I prioritized ethical data handling, clear communication, and structured project management to ensure high-quality deliverables. This project demonstrates how data-driven strategies and predictive analytics can empower YTG to transition into digital platforms, gain a competitive edge, and make informed business decisions in a dynamic e-commerce environment.
